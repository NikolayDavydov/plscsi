[[[If a link labelled &quot;<strong>write once, breaks everywhere</strong>&quot; brought you here,

<h2>Since February 12, 2003:</h2>
</p>

<p>
We launched a GUI effort.
We're discussing it in email, not yet in web pages.
But we do have some .png screen shots collected together with our .zip's of .java sources:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<a href="http://members.aol.com/plforth/console/scsi/">

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We found some new
<a href="bugs.html">bugs</a>
in our own stuff,
and the new
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=813908">813908</a>
Microsoft explanation
for how passing thru op x1A ModeSense6 of a header may crash Win 2K.
</p>

<p>
In the field, we saw Win XP round DOWN the length of data copied
by a command like: -x "12 0 0 0 05 0" -i x05 // Inquiry for up to 5.
Misaligning the data address doesn't help.
Offline we're told other people have seen Win XP hang.
</p>

<blockquote>

<h2>Since December 21, 2002:</h2>
</p>

<p>
We continued the rework of December 7, 2002.
The &quot;Related Tools&quot; no longer appear all together
in <a href="why.html">why.html</a>
but instead now appear sorted by operating system:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<a href="linux.html">Linux</a> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<a href="windows.html">Windows</a> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<a href="dos.html">Dos</a> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<a href="mac.html">Mac</a>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
On the other hand, we've added, unlinked except from here,
a (highly technical) cross-platform page
to discuss the plug 'n play descriptors of Usb Storage devices:
<a href="tools/usbpnp.html">
tools/usbpnp.html</a>
</p>

<p>
In the Linux page, we provided the promised example
of what plscsi -w success looks like.
On the Windows page, we corrected the BusTools link.
To the Mac page, we added PhotoCop.
</p>

<h2>Since December 7, 2002:</h2>
</p>

<p>
1: We've completely reworked the site (i.e. <a href="http://members.aol.com/plscsi/">PLScsi</a>)
to suit people who begin with just one platform:
people who work with less than all the platforms we support.
</p>

<p>
2: The old site map also made it hard for you to review our bugs and code.
We think this new site map could make this easy ... but it doesn't yet, sorry.

<h2>Since October 31, 2002:</h2>

<p>
Not only do the six char disk/cd drive names "\\.\$letter:" work,
for instance \\.\I:,
but also the nine or more char names "\\.\TAPE$n",
for instance <b>\\.\TAPE0</b>.
However, we find the latter work only with tape devices
that appear listed in DeviceManager as "Tape drives",
rather than as "Unknown devices".
</p>

<p>
Rumour tells us:
there is a programmer on earth
who found PLScsi just before taking on the job of writing such a thing.
</p>

<p>
Rumour tells us:
one of the multi-LUN device folk
patched a driver for Win 98/ME
to enumerate multiple LUN's like PLScsi does.
</p>

<p>
Our
<a href="bugs.html">bugs.html</a> and
<a href="thanks.html">thanks.html</a>
are now more complete.
We now say "Out to" where we had been wrongly saying "Out from",
thanks for writing to tell us.
</p>

<p>
We now lead our <a href="index.html">index.html</a>
with our three favourite links elsewhere,
we now bold (via Strong tags)
more of the <a href="index.html">index.html</a>,
and we mention the issue of residue accurate to the byte.
</p>

<p>
See now at <a href="index.html#why">index.html#why</a> "Safer tools" that:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Boot Linux from CD, without having to modify your HDD<br>
Poke around in the Windows registry<br>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Also at <a href="bugs.html">bugs.html</a> we not only discuss the known bugs
(including new feature requests) but we now we also
go ahead and link to some assorted stuff
we have posted but not well-linked.

<h2>And before all that:</h2>

<p>
We released the 2002/09/22 edition to
<a href="index.html#downloads">index.html#downloads</a><br>
</p>

<p>
We released the 2002/07/08 edition: as yet only <b>Dos & Win & Linux</b>.<br>
<a href="2002/07/08/">2002/07/08/</a>
</p>

<p>
<b>We wish we had written the Linux edition first.</b>
We found we could port back to Dos & Win from Linux
more easily than the other way,
which argues that in Linux we could more easily see
how we should write code to run across platforms.
We remember realising in particular that a device name
should be a string of chars.
Device names in Dos & Win were less arbitrary.
</p>

<p>
We released the 2002/04/09 edition: Dos only, source may be lost, first hints of Linux:<br>
<a href="20020409/">20020409/</a>
</p>

<p>
We released a Win NT/ 2K/ XP only edition, years ago, only by email reflector not by http.
</p>

<p>
We released a Dos only edition sometime before that, only by person-to-person email.
