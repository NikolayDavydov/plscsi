<h1>the #if of "scsi.cpp"</h1>

<p>
Here we review the #if of "scsi.cpp" of
<a href="../../../2002/09/22/plscsi.zip">
../../../2002/09/22/plscsi.zip</a>
</p>

<p>
Perhaps you can disentangle this more elegantly?
</p>

<p>
We support four kinds of connection: sgio, sptx,
winaspi, dosaspi, on three platforms.  As yet, Linux
talks only sgio.  Windows talks only sptx and winaspi.
Dos talks only dosaspi.
</p>

<p>
As we learn to support more kinds of connection, e.g.
a virtual Scsi device passing thru to a backing file,
etc., then all platforms will be supporting more than
one kind of connection.
</p>

<p>
While enumerating devices, we want to newScsi once,
and then scsiOpen/scsiClose repeatedly, at least
until we code a deleteScsi to recover the memory that
newScsi leaks.
</p>

<p>
We want to scsiSetErr after we newScsi but before we
scsiOpen, so that we can discard stderr while
enumerating devices.
</p>

<p>
Given a device name, we want scsiOpen to try to open
each possible kind of connection, but stop after the
first success.
</p>

<p>
Given an open connection, we want many calls to apply
only to that open connection: scsiLimitSense,
scsiLimitSeconds, scsiSay, scsiGetLength,
scsiGetSense.
</p>

<p>
For example, we want to be able to set a Linux sgio
timeout to more than 30 hours, even though the
winaspi scsiLimitSeconds rejects such an argument as
being inexpressibly out-of-range.
</p>

<p>
Of all we're doing in "scsi.cpp", only these calls
immediately above look like virtual method invocations.
</p>

<p>
scsiReadName resembles scsiOpen in that scsiReadName
consults each possible kind of connection in order to
list all possible devices names, but differs by
retrying til each kind of connection reports
end-of-list, rather than stopping after the first
success.
</p>

<p>
scsiSwallowArg is more like scsiOpen: when first it
finds a kind of connection that accepts an arg
(passed in from the command line via -X), it then
disables all the remaining kinds of connection from
future consideration by scsiOpen or scsiReadName or
scsiSwallowArg.
</p>

<p>
If #if in the .cpp are evil, then how should we code
all this?
</p>

<p>
We hesitated to make each platform support every kind
of connection, by the rule of trying not to burden
each platform with the troubles of the other.  For
example, #if __MSDOS__ has no sgio.
</p>

<p>
We hesitated to make each kind of connection support
all the operations of the others, by the same rule.
For example, dosaspi.cpp has no aspiLimitSeconds,
and *aspi.cpp has no aspiClose.
</p>

<p>
We hesitated to standardise on sgio.  First of all,
that would discriminate against all the clueless
programmers that think Windows is the whole world.
Also, over the years, sgio hasn't been stable, and it
currently includes many options that we have never
tried to exercise, options that we don't yet
understand.
</p>

<p>
In place of #if in "scsi.cpp", what should we do?
</p>

<hr>
<p><a href="#contents">Contents</a></p>
<a name="if-of-h"></a>
<h1>the #if of "*.h"</h1>
</p>

<p>
Here we review the #if of the *.h of
<a href="../../../2002/09/22/plscsi.zip">
../../../2002/09/22/plscsi.zip</a>
</p>

<p>
&gt; winaspi.h<br>
&gt; wnaspi32.h<br>
</p>

<p>
These .h files we didn't write, we copied unchanged, so
to these we make no changes.
</p>

<p>
The only other .h are: dosaspi.h plscsi.h winsg.h
</p>

<p>
&gt; dosaspi.h:#ifndef DOSASPI_H<br>
&gt; plscsi.h:#ifndef PLSCSI_H<br>
</p>

<p>
These #if... exist to compile the .h file once only
no matter if repeatedly included.  We could/should fix
winsg.h to allow this also.
</p>

<p>
&gt; plscsi.h:#ifdef __cplusplus<br>
</p>

<p>
This #if... we need to link with .c code.
</p>

<p>
We chose .cpp partly because some of us like the c99 feature of
declaring a var where we initialise it and partly
because the MS $$ Win tools expect people to use .cpp.
</p>

<p>
&gt; winsg.h:#ifdef _WIN32<br>
</p>

<p>
This #if... is a comment, redundant with the / * * /
comment above it that says winsg.h exists to:
</p>

<p>
Pretend to link with Linux SG_IO when compiled for
Windows.
</p>

<p>
That is, given this file, we can use a Windows
compiler to confirm in our Linux source we have no
silly compile errors, though maybe we still have link
errors and runtime bugs.
</p>

<p>
&gt; plscsi.h:#if 0<br>
&gt; plscsi.h:#include <stdio.h> /* FILE ... */<br>
&gt; plscsi.h:#endif<br>
</p>

<p>
The issue here is how to document that we need names
like FILE defined for plscsi.h to make sense.
</p>

<p>
[[[We've since heard the argument, paraphrased from K&amp;R,
that if we use FILE in a .h, then we should #include
a definition of it, else a caller could #include
a definition other than what we used when compiling the code.]]]
</p>

<p>
&gt; plscsi.h:#ifdef __MSDOS__<br>
&gt; ...<br>
&gt; #define CALLOC farcalloc<br>
</p>

<p>
Maybe these #if... we like?
</p>

<p>
These exist to let plscsi work with more than INT_MAX
bytes of memory in places where INT_MAX is just x7FFF,
such as the free DOS compilers
that work no matter what we do beyond the first 640KiB.
</p>

<p>
&gt; plscsi.h:#ifndef _WIN32<br>
&gt; plscsi.h:#ifndef __MSDOS__<br>
</p>

<p>
These exist because we don't have good `make`
solutions for Dos & Windows.
</p>

<p>
In Dos CLI we build *.c*,
because we don't know the 8.3 names of our source files.
In Dos GUI and Win GUI we add *.c* to the build,
partly because the binary (not text) Makefile of the
Win GUI is Huge, even when .zip compressed.
</p>

<p>
&gt; plscsi.h:#ifdef DOSASPI<br>
&gt; plscsi.h:#ifdef WINASPI<br>
</p>

<p>
These exist to make #ifdef XXXASPI become shorthand
for #if (defined(DOSASPI) | defined(WINASPI)).
</p>

<p>
Some of our development tools (e.g. display only the code
that compiles) understand a single short #ifdef like
that better than than the otherwise equivalent, newer,
longer form.
</p>

<p>
&gt; plscsi.h:#ifdef XXXASPI<br>
&gt; plscsi.h:#ifdef SGIO<br>
&gt; plscsi.h:#ifdef SPTX<br>
</p>

<p>
These exist to avoid declaring routines that don't
exist.  These help make a compile warning out of what
would otherwise be a link error.

<a name="if-of-cpp"></a>
<h1>the #if of "*.cpp"</h1>

<p>
Here we review the #if of the *.cpp of
<a href="../../../2002/09/22/plscsi.zip">
../../../2002/09/22/plscsi.zip</a>
</p>

<p>
&gt; cl.cpp<br>
&gt; plscsi.cpp<br>
</p>

<p>
These are free of the #if evil.
</p>

<p>
&gt; scsistub.cpp:        #ifdef SGIO<br>
&gt; ...<br>
</p>

<p>
These are a short form of what we see in "scsi.cpp".
When we fix "scsi.cpp", maybe these will disappear?
</p>

<p>
Indeed, the idea of "scsistub.cpp" is to be as small
as possible: to show how to talk to a specific
platform, such as Linux ioctl SG_IO, without having
to involve any #if.
</p>

<p>
If we really do kill of the #if of "scsi.cpp", then
maybe "scsistub.cpp" goes away all together.  We were
pleased to see how dramatically it shrunk between the
last two revisions of plscsi.  We took that shrinkage
as a sign that we were moving in the right direction.
</p>

<p>
&gt; scsi.cpp:#ifdef SGIO<br>
&gt; ...<br>
</p>

<p>
These are legion, and Evil.  How to be less evil
there has us stumped. See
<a href="#if-of-scsi-cpp">the #if of "scsi.cpp"</a><br>
</p>

<p>
&gt; dosaspi.cpp:#ifdef DOSASPI<br>
&gt; sgio.cpp:#ifdef SGIO<br>
&gt; sgio.cpp:#ifdef _WIN32<br>
&gt; sptx.cpp:#ifdef SPTX<br>
&gt; wideint.cpp:#ifdef __MSDOS__<br>
&gt; winaspi.cpp:#ifdef WINASPI<br>
</p>

<p>
These have #if only because of the make troubles
discussed in
<a href="#if-of-h">the #if of "*.h"</a>
</p>

<p>
We hear some may
have some kind of development tool that chokes when
lots of code outside of an .h file is enclosed by #if?
Maybe people lose colour in the text?
</p>

<p>
&gt; sgio.cpp:#ifdef _WIN32<br>
</p>

<p>
Except also this #if exists so we can duck the work of
kluging Win C compilation environments to understand
Linux-specific code like:
</p>

<p>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <sys/ioctl.h>
#include <scsi/sg.h>
</p>

<p>
&gt; wideint.cpp:    #ifdef __MSDOS__<br>
&gt; wideint.cpp:    #ifdef __MSDOS__<br>
</p>

<p>
And also these appear, like the #if of "winsg.h", to
scream that the code enclosed (here a not-flat
address space) is extremly platform-specific.
</p>

<p>
&gt; scl.cpp:#if (_WIN32 || __MSDOS__)<br>
&gt; scl.cpp:#ifdef __MSDOS__<br>
</p>

<p>
These decide by platform what to #include to allow
binary data to pipe thru plscsi.
</p>

<p>
In Linux, this takes no work, but Dos & Windows each
require a different kind of work.  Again, it's not
easy (I actually never discovered precisely how) to
make one platform understand the #include syntax of
the other.
</p>

<p>
&gt; scl.cpp:#if (_WIN32 || __MSDOS__)<br>
&gt; scl.cpp:#if (_WIN32 || __MSDOS__)<br>
&gt; scl.cpp:#if (_WIN32 || __MSDOS__)<br>
&gt; scl.cpp:#if (_WIN32 || __MSDOS__)<br>
</p>

<p>
These substitute "set" for "export", "NUL" for
"/dev/null", and insert the work Dos & Windows
require to allow binary data to pipe thru plscsi.
