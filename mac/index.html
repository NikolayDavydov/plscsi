Apple and other folks move away their links from time to time. If you discover my links here are broken, please do tell me, I'd be delighted to help fix them.
As of this writing, I was easiest to reach via Twitter, as @pelavarre.

Latest buzz says the @wagerlabs JReymont
article re a kernel patch
to include the free speech right of Scsi Pass Through privilege
as a root privilege same in Mac OS X as in Windows &amp; Linux
has migrated to:

</p>
<p>
I haven't dug in myself, but I get the false or true
impression that work is a demo of all the intriguing conceptual engagement required,
without actually attempting or completing the work of solving the Mac emulation of this part of Windows &amp. Linux.

<p>
See here my freshest summary of this silly head-in-the-sand controversy pointlessly kept alive by Apple.
</p>
<p>
Yes possible in Mac OS X. Much more engagement and work required than any other Op Sys, and I haven't yet made time to dig in like that myself, in all these many years now. I care because I have only Mac OS X at home, but I don't care so very much because I often work in places that have only Linux & Windows, or only Scsi connections missing from all the Mac's in my home, like Usb2 back in the day or Sas now.
</p>
<p>
In all other op sys that I've tried, root privilege includes SCSI Pass Through privilege. Mac OS X thinks differently, to no apparent benefit, as if implementing a defeated copy-restriction. Mac OS X gives root SCSI Pass Through privilege only to DVD/CD devices and only when no disc mounted.
</p>
<p>
I once freed a week over Christmas to give me the time to learn to write the patch to fix this in Mac OS X, but then I fell deathly sick that week and lost that chance. I am myself so unengaged with Apple development just now that I never got Xcode running for more than days, and here in 2010-10 I don't have Snow Leopard 10.6 Mac OS X running.
</p>
<p>
The web tells me @wagerlabs JReymont else has published this patch that Apple likely never will find the sense to integrate, despite their own iPad/ iPhone/ iPod team demoing the need for it. Somehow, to Apple, your needs matter less than their needs. They just don't get it. Their canned publication of their witlessness here is:
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/qa/qa2001/qa1179.html">Apple QA1179</a><br>
</p>
<p>
Web buzz also tells me Apple has demystified this mess to some degree at:
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#samplecode/VendorSpecificType00/Introduction/Intro.html">
http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#samplecode/VendorSpecificType00/Introduction/Intro.html</a>
</p>
<p>
Less than all of us see this as an issue of the abuse-of-power politics and unprofessional disrespect that I see. To my eyes, this is Apple getting away with antisocial behaviour because they are big. Not everyone sees this that way. Might send me off in a more productive direction to get more clueful people like the Eff.org to comment.

<u>http://tinyco.de/2009/02/04/writing-a-mac-osx-usb-device-driver-with-scsi-pass-through.html</u>
is the only open source example I know
of someone who's gone and fixed the Mac kernel
to support Windows DeviceIoControl SCSI_PASS_THROUGH_DIRECT
like it should natively.
</p>
<p>
The old text below discusses how running the kernel as misdelivered by Apple
lets you match that Windows service
only when your device self-identifies as
T10.org PeripheralDeviceType (PDT) x05 Dvd/Cd
and otherwise NOT!
</p>
<p>
Kudos to Apple's (reasonably free reasonably public) ata-scsi-dev list
for bringing the TinyCo.de work to my attention.
</p>
<p>
Send me e-mail to tell me you actually exist, making time to read this page,
and I might get around to formatting it nicely. So far in my own life
I haven't made the time to develop Mac OS X kernel patches myself,
so long as we agree to discount
mostly obsolete [And Ppc Only] Open Mac Boot Forth exercises.

<p> Welcome, bienvenido, bienvenue!&nbsp; Per your kind encouragement,<br>
</p>
<p>We have the 2004-07-14: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="gcsmac.tar.gz">gcsmac.tar.gz</a></p>
<p>That's plscsi almost working on the Mac for "authoring" devices.<br>
</p>
<p>Known issues appear in blog if you search for "Mac" among the: <a
 href="http://plavarre.blog-city.com/read/579210.htm">plscsi issues</a><br>
</p>
<p>"Almost working" here now means only the gccscsi layer: as yet back
port completed of the command-line parsing.&nbsp; Also no examples yet,
apart from op x12 "INQUIRY".<br>
</p>
<p>Nastiest remaining technical issue is the naming of devices.&nbsp;
Mac OS X naturally gives no name to the device: it's just the n-th
"authoring" device found.&nbsp; Possibly we should learn to make the
free BSD disc name work, such as /dev/disk2.<br>
</p>
<p>Second nastiest remaining technical issue are the significant side
effects of the open/ close in the launch-open-ioctl-close-exit sequence
that's fundamental to the idea of plscsi at the command line.&nbsp; In
Mac OS X, open works only if preceded by diskutil unmount (that's
"unmount" not "umount"), and close provokes automount, ouch.<br>
</p>
<p>[Note: You got this update to this web page courtesy the bug in
Mozilla Composer that often substitutes file: links for relative http:
links.&nbsp; The PLScsi/ link here above was broken that way.]<br>
</p>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p>Per the progress blogged at: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><a
 href="http://plavarre.blog-city.com/read/531013.htm">to plscsi for Mac
OS X from "autut"</a> </p>
<p>Mac OS X by design passes SCSI thru to "authoring" devices without
root privilege, yet to no other devices despite root privilege, for
reasons that <a href="http://lists.apple.com/mhonarc/ata-scsi-dev/">ata-scsi-dev</a>
finds ineffable.&nbsp; We now have plscsi working well enough on the Mac
to hope to discover what a Mac OS X "authoring" device is in terms of
t10.org primitives. </p>
<p>Our first guess: to connect without kext, a device has to claim PDT
x05 = MMC and then report DVD/ CD writable in legacy mode page
x2A.&nbsp; That definition would make an "authoring" device out of any
standard device that writes CD-R, CD-RW, DVD-R, DVD-RW, or
DVD-RAM.&nbsp; But that definition would exclude DVD+RW and other MMC
that didn't also write one of those other kinds of discs, but maybe no
such devices exist.</p>

      <h1>2. Why Only the Mac Doesn't Work</h1>
      <p>In creating Mac OS X, Apple reworked the I/O of free
BSD.&nbsp; That rework excluded the free BSD ioctl SCIOCCOMMAND, whoops.
 </p>
      <p>Via similar ioctl, when root-privileged, we see SCSI pass thru
working in all of Linux, Win XP/2K, Win ME/9X, Dos and Mac OF (Open
Firmware boot Forth.&nbsp; Always we try ATAPI and USB, as yet we have
tried FireWire only in Win/Dos (: noone has yet donated an iPod to us.
:) </p>
      <p>We hear Linux boots from CD on Mac, we wish we knew how.&nbsp;
We know Mac OF boots from Command+Option+O+F on Mac.&nbsp; Rebooting
outside of Mac OS X may violate your Apple warranty, just as
roll-your-own firmware upgrade may violate your drive warranty.</p>
      <p>Maybe true Mac "Darwin" geeks can patch Mac OS X with a "kext"
to allow root privileged pass through.&nbsp; We do not know how.</p>
      <p>Noone knowledgeable has chosen to explain clearly why Apple
exclude SCSI pass thru privilege from root privilege.&nbsp; We know we
do not understand.<br>
      </p>
      <p>We see root-privileged Mac OS X Terminal commands widely
published that in fact overwhelm file permission security and closely
resemble commands that smash your hard drive, e.g.:<br>
      <br>
      </p>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px; font-weight: bold;"> sudo dd
if=/dev/disk0 bs=512 skip=0 count=1 | hexdump -C </div>
      <p>By faith we assume the Mac OS X design to omit SCSI pass thru
has some coherent technical rationale.&nbsp; We have requested and
promptly received, time and time again, free expert help from Apple
engineers of Apple's ata-scsi-dev newsgroup, yet the help we receive we
find technically incomprehensible.&nbsp; We do not understand, we do not
know why.<br>
      </p>
      <p>A less concise presentation of our utter mystification appears
in the previous edition of this page.<br>
      </p>
      <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
      <h1>3. SCSI Pass Thru Design<br>
      </h1>
      <p>Some people say pass through, some people say pass thru, some
people say bridge.</p>
      <p>Suppose, to bridge design, we try to apply the Internet design
principle:<br>
      </p>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Be liberal in what you accept, be
conservative in what you send.<br>
      </div>
      <p> In bridge design, we have to choose.&nbsp; We can choose to
trust an opaque bridge to translate the command, or we can choose to
pass trouble thru a transparent bridge.&nbsp; An opaque bridge is not
liberal in what it accepts.&nbsp; A transparent bridge is not
conservative in what sends.&nbsp; Ouch.&nbsp; We conclude:<br>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Bridges by definition cannot be
well-designed.</p>
      <p>Accordingly, here we collect ways in which SCSI pass thru
crashes operating systems.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Early 2.4 Linux crashes if you try Inquiry for zero:<br>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">-y "12 00:00:00 00 00"<br>
      </p>
      <p>Linux folk corrected Linux immediately, naturally.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Win 2K crashes if you try mode sense of a header at a time
with a device for which Windows incorrectly translate to op x5A Mode
Sense (10) from op x1A Mode Sense (6):</p>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">-i 4 -y "1A 00:3F:00 04 00"<br>
      </div>
      <p>Microsoft corrected Windows immediately after we found a
sponsor to pay Microsoft to listen to us, years after we found hints of
the trouble, six months after we constructed a short demo.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Against the theory that bridges can't work well, we have one
confusing counterexample.<br>
      <br>
Certain USB/ ATAPI PIO bridges actually do work well in practice.&nbsp;
With those, the host begins by passing to the bridge a complete
description of how the host would have spoken ATAPI PIO.&nbsp; The
bridge at least once invisibly negotiates max PIO mode and thereafter
transparently reproduces how the host would have treated a
direct-attached device.&nbsp; And that system works.</p>
      <p>By contrast, bridges to ATAPI DMA don't work quite so
well.&nbsp; The standard description of how the host would have spoken
ATAPI PIO doesn't mention how the ATAPI DMA host would have miscounted
bytes with a direct attached device, so the bridge can't reproduce that
behaviour exactly. <br>
