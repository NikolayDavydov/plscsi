## Conversation

Talk to me if this work interests you.

Like tell me you're bothered by 1 of the 31 broken links, and I'll try to fix it.

To talk to me quickly, find me plainly in public at https://twitter.com/pelavarre

To talk to me slowly, find me 1x1 unencrypted at mailto:p.lavarre@ieee.org

It is conversation when you can't control what you say, how long it takes, and where it goes. - TGross STurkle
