<h1><a href="http://www.bswd.com/cornucop.htm">Storage/</a> <a
 href="../">PLScsi/</a> FAQ/</h1>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">1: What's SCSI?</span>
<p>A term that means many too many things, like the term
"Java".<br>
</p>
<p>When we say SCSI here, we mean:<br>
</p>
<p>The popular way of directly attaching storage devices that
includes SCSI over IP or TCP/IP (e.g. iSCSI), SCSI over 1394 (aka
FireWire aka iLink), SCSI over USB, SCSI over IDE (aka ATAPI, PATAPI,
SATAPI), SCSI over
LPT (legacy PC printer port), and of course classic parallel
SCSI.&nbsp;
Also Linux &amp; Windows include soft bridges from SCSI to ATA (aka
PATA, SATA).<br>
</p>
<h3>2: What's PLScsi?</h3>
<p>"Programming Language, SCSI".<br>
</p>
<p>That is, the SCSI-over-whatever work of Pat LaVarre &amp; friends,
in
particular the SCSI command line offered
here.</p>
<p>Why such a personal name? <a href="../google.html">For the sake
of Google</a>. </p>
<h3>3: While learning to use PLScsi, I accidentally smashed my
hard drive, can you help?</h3>
<p>Probably NOT. Please do backup your hard drives before you run
PLScsi, rather than living thru the pain of having PLScsi teach you
that
you need to backup more often. Often we prepare Windows to recover from
a crash
with such commercial tools as Ghost and Partition Magic.&nbsp; Often we
back up Mac via Carbon Copy Cloner.<br>
