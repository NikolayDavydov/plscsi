      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Welcome to the plscsi tutorial, presented in 6 chapters and 1
appendix.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Please write <a href="mailto:p.lavarre@ieee.org">Pat LaVarre</a>
if you have questions.<br>
      </p>
      <p>We actually first wrote these words as the email replies to a
series of delightfully clarifying questions sent to us by Andr&eacute;
Wilmus in September, 2003.&nbsp; By email <span
 style="font-style: italic;">ofrecemos una traducci&oacute;n
espa&ntilde;ola</span>, and by email <span style="font-style: italic;">nous
offrons une traduction fran&ccedil;aise</span>.&nbsp; Alta Vista <a
 href="http://world.altavista.com/">Babel Fish</a>, a free service for
translating among some natural languages, began both translations for us.<br>
      </p>
      <p>This tutorial walks you thru the questions many people ask
when first trying out plscsi.<br>
      <br>
By definition, each plscsi command line asks:<br>
      </p>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <p>1) to copy CDB Out</p>
      </div>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> 2) to copy Data In, to copy Data
Out, or to copy No Data at all<br>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">3) to copy Status In, and to copy
Auto Sense In after any autosensable failure<br>
      </p>
      <p>The traditional host-centred SCSI convention defines what we
mean by the words In and Out.&nbsp; That convention says to copy In is
to copy in to the host from the device.&nbsp; Also to copy Out is to
copy out from the host to the device.<br>

      <h1>1. All About You</h1>
      <p>Sorry you found PLScsi difficult enough to want a tutorial,
thank you for finding the time to work thru this tutorial.<br>
      <br>
We're not sure what to tell you, because we do not know what you do and
do not already understand.<br>
      </p>
      <p>If you write for further help, please then share the answers
to one of (or more of) the Nine questions:<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">1) What do you want your DVD/
CD/ HDD/ RMB to do?</span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">2) How did you find PLScsi?</span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">3) What plscsi command did you
try that gave you unexpected results?</span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">4) Did you begin with `plscsi
-w`?&nbsp; What result did you get?</span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">5) Where are you trying to learn
plscsi</span>: on Linux 2.6/ 2.4, Win XP/ 2K, Win ME/ 9X, Dos, Mac OF,
what<span style="font-weight: bold;">?<br>
      </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">6) </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Have you already backed up your hard drive</span>,
for fear of plscsi crashing your operating system as you requested
while you were learning to say what you mean<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">?</span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">7) Do you already know many
CDB's, </span>for example that -x "1B 00:00:00 02 00" means Eject,
sometimes described as Stop Unit LoEj<span style="font-weight: bold;">?</span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">8) Have you already tried pldd?</span>&nbsp;
pldd, plscsi, and gccscsi work at progressively lower levels of the
operating system.&nbsp; The lower the level you target, the more easily
you can make a mistake that crashes your operating system.&nbsp; In
October 2003, pldd was freely available for Linux, Win 2K/XP, and Mac
OS X.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">9) Are you a C programmer
yourself?&nbsp;</span> If so then you may prefer gccscsi - a macro
language for writing short C programs that talk SCSI, programs compiled
by the free C compilers of Linux/ Windows/ Dos.<br>
      </p>
      <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
      <h1>2. SCSI Devices Named How</h1>
What do we mean by such syntax as /dev/sg9 and \\.\A: and 9.1.0?<br>
      <br>
These are example device names.<br>
      <br>
We don't know what the name of your device is.&nbsp; The command
`plscsi -w` should tell you the name of all your connected devices that
accept SCSI pass thru.&nbsp; In Win 2K/XP, the Disk Manager of My
Computer --&gt; Properties --&gt; Manage draws a picture of how you
have connected devices.&nbsp; In Mac OS X, the Apple System Profiler of
Apple --&gt; About This Mac --&gt; More Info draws that picture.<br>
      <br>
Linux uses /dev/sg* names.&nbsp; Often /dev/sg[a-z] alias
/dev/sg/[0-9]*.<br>
      <br>
Win 2K/XP uses the names \\.\A: through \\.\Z: for DVD/ CD and HDD/
RMB.&nbsp; Also Win 2K/XP uses the name \\.\TAPE0 for the first tape
drive, etc. (notice no trailing colon).<br>
      <br>
Win 95/98/ME and Dos uses names like 9.1.0, names unrelated to drive
letters.<br>
      <br>
Mac OS X doesn't include a published SCSI pass thru interface
yet.&nbsp; pldd works with filenames and raw block devices such as the
/dev/disk0 that often is your boot drive (analogous to Windows \\.\C:).<br>
      <br>
And we have more to say about WIn 2K/XP ...<br>
      <br>
\\ is a Windows convention for beginning a path name that is not an
ordinary file name.&nbsp; Ordinarily .\ is a suffix you can add to any
folder name without changing its meaning.&nbsp; Ordinarily xyz\.\ is the
same as xyz\, but we think Iwe remember here you will find that \\.\
works and that \\ does not.<br>
      <br>
Win 2K/XP adds the four char prefix \\.\ to make a SCSI pass thru
device name out of a drive letter.&nbsp; More than one device name can
mean the same HDD (hard disk drive).&nbsp; For example, C: D: E: might
be the three partitions of your boot HDD.&nbsp; If so, then the first
block of C:, the first block of D:, and the first block of E: are all
different.&nbsp; But the first block of \\.\C: and the first block of
\\.\D: and the first block of \\.\E: are all the same block,
specifically the first block of C:.&nbsp; Learning this fact on your
own can hurt, especially if C: is your boot drive.<br>
      <br>
More clear than mud, yet?&nbsp; Please write to tell us if not!<br>
      <br>
      <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
      <h1>3. The First Three Commands To Try<br>
      </h1>
      <p>We believe you can start after listing available devices:<br>
      </p>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px; font-weight: bold;">
      <pre><big>plscsi -w<br></big></pre>
      </div>
      <p>The same device names listed by plscsi -w work in pldd and in
gccscsi.<br>
      </p>
      <p>You may wish to select a single device via such techniques as:</p>
      <pre style="margin-left: 40px;"><big>export plscsi=/dev/sg9</big></pre>
      <pre style="margin-left: 40px;"><big>set PLSCSI=\\.\A:<br></big></pre>
      <pre style="margin-left: 40px;"><big>set PLSCSI=9.1.0<br></big></pre>
      <pre style="margin-left: 40px;"><big>setenv plscsi /dev/disk0</big><br></pre>
      <p>plscsi -w should print such suggested command lines separately
from the commentary which says more about which names select which
devices, but earlier versions did not.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Apart from plscsi -w, we recommend you start with:</p>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px; font-weight: bold;">
      <pre><big>plscsi -vx "12 00:00:00 24 00" -i x24</big></pre>
      </div>
      <p>This is a more explicit way of asking plscsi to do what plscsi
does by default, as plscsi -wv and plscsi -v and plscsi -- will tell you.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Op x12 is INQUIRY.&nbsp; Among the x24 bytes of Data copied In
you should see the name of your device.</p>
      <p>The ':' colons are meaningless commentary, you can use ' '
blanks if you prefer.</p>
      <p>Maybe next you try:</p>
      <pre style="margin-left: 40px; font-weight: bold;"><big>plscsi -vx "00 00:00:00 00 00"</big></pre>
      <p>Op x00 is TEST UNIT READY.&nbsp; We recommend this command
because playing with this command can teach you what success and failure
look like.&nbsp; This command will succeed if retried enough while the
disc is present and spun up, but will fail when the disc is absent,
arriving, or leaving.&nbsp; Also this command copies No Data, by
design, that is this command copies only Cdb Out and Status and Auto
Sense In.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Maybe next you try:</p>
      <pre style="margin-left: 40px; font-weight: bold;"><big>plscsi -vx "25 00 00:00:00:00 00 00:00 00" -i 8</big></pre>
      <p>Op x25 is READ CAPACITY.&nbsp; We recommend this command
because it reports the maxLba (i.e. the count of blocks minus one) and
the bytes per block.<br>
      <br>
We use ':' colon commentary in place of ' ' blank commentary to help us
get the length of such a cdb correct - ten bytes - and to help us
remember such facts as the lba of op x28 appearing in bytes 2:3:4:5,
not bytes 1:2:3:4 and not bytes 3:4:5:6.<br>
      </p>
      <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
      <h1>4. Reading Your First Block<br>
      </h1>
      <p>After working thru the simpler exercises above, you may be
ready to try tackling the more complex job of reading one block.<br>
      <br>
The trouble with reading blocks is that first you and the drive have to
negotiate the count of bytes per block.&nbsp; Often you can cheat: you
can assume a count and see that it works.&nbsp; Most DVD/ CD wake up
saying&nbsp; each read block holds 2 KiB = x800 bytes.&nbsp; Most HDD/
RMB wake up saying each read block holds 0.5 KiB = x200 bytes.<br>
      <br>
With drives like UDF CD-RW, often we begin with:<br>
      </p>
      <pre style="margin-left: 40px; font-weight: bold;"><big>plscsi -vx "28 00 00:00:00:10 00 00:01 00" -i x800</big></pre>
      <p>In pldd syntax, that same command is:</p>
      <pre style="margin-left: 40px; font-weight: bold;"><big>pldd if=/dev/sg9 of bs=2k count=1<br></big></pre>
      <p>The first byte of the cdb, also known as cdb[0], is the
"opcode", nicknamed "op".<br>
      </p>
      <p>Op x28 is READ (10).&nbsp; In this example, the first block
address is cdb[2:3:4:5] = x00:00:00:10 = 16.&nbsp; The count of blocks
is cdb[7:8] = x00:01.&nbsp; At 2 KiB = x800 bytes per block, x00:01
blocks is x800 bytes, therefore we say -i x800.<br>
      <br>
We're curious to know if these commands work for you or not.&nbsp; I
hear DVD/ CD make reading difficult.</p>
      <p>In particular we've heard that we may have to issue op x5A
Mode Sense 10 to copy soft switches of the device In and op x55 Mode
Select 10 to copy soft switches Out.&nbsp; Learning to copy soft
switches goes quickly.&nbsp; Learning what the switches mean and what
the switches should say, that takes longer.<br>
      </p>
      <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
      <h1>5. Decrypting Success</h1>
      <p> </p>
      <p>An example of success after asking to read one block from a
DVD/ CD is:</p>
      <pre style="margin-left: 40px;"><big>&gt; plscsi -vx "28 08 00:00:00:00 00 00:01 00" -i x800<br>x 00000000 28 08 00:00:00:10 00 00:01 00 .. .. .. .. .. .. "(H@@@P@@A@"<br>x 00000000 00:00:00:00 00:00:00:00 00:00:00:00 00:00:00:00 "@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@"<br>...<br>x 000007F0 00:00:00:00 00:00:00:00 00:00:00:00 00:00:00:00 "@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@"<br>// 0 = plscsi.main exit int<br>&gt;<br></big></pre>
      <p>If you see something enough like this, congratulations!&nbsp;
You are reading single blocks!<br>
      <br>
You're also tracing the blocks you read to the screen.&nbsp; If you'd
rather store the blocks to a file, you could instead say something like:<br>
      </p>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <p> plscsi -x "28 00 00:00:00:10 00 00:01 00" -i 0x800 -t x10.bin</p>
      </div>
      <p>In that example, we've changed the selected lba = cdb[2:3:4:5]
= x0000:0010 = x10.<br>
      </p>
      <p>You should get the same results, no matter which syntax you
choose from among:</p>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <p> -i 0x800<br>
-i x800<br>
-ix800<br>
-i2048<br>
...</p>
      </div>
      <p> Another equivalent syntax is:<br>
      </p>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <p> plscsi -x "28 00 00:00:00:10 00 00:01 00" -i x800 -t ""
&gt;x10.bin</p>
      </div>
      <p> We bother to mention this equivalence because this equivalence
lets you use the | pipe char ('\x7C'), if already you know how to use
that | pipe char in a command line, for example:<br>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> plscsi -x "28 00 00:00:00:10 00
00:01 00" -i x800 -t "" | hexdump -C<br>
      </p>
      <p>Of ever you do choose to view data via plscsi -v, then
you&nbsp; may wish to understand:<br>
      </p>
      <p>plscsi -v does trace all the data, but plscsi compresses the
display of some kinds of less interesting trace data.&nbsp; In email, a
"..." ellipsis can mean merely "omitted", but here plscsi prints "..."
ellipsis only to mean duplicate lines omitted.&nbsp; This works much
like the "*" convention of linux hexdump -C, except that plscsi omits
only the duplicate lines in the middle, not also the last duplicate line.<br>
      </p>
      <p>More specifically, in the example here above, plscsi prints
lots of "00" to tell us us explicitly that the x10 bytes at offset x0
and the x10 bytes at offset x7F0 are zero, but then plscsi prints "..."
to tell us the x10 bytes at the offsets x 10 20 ... 7E0 (a total of x7E0
= x800 - x20 bytes) are also zero.<br>
      <br>
More clear than mud, yet?</p>
      <p> </p>

      <h1>6. Decrypting Failure</h1>
      <p> An example of failure after asking to read one block from a
DVD/ CD is:</p>
      <pre style="margin-left: 40px;"><big>&gt; plscsi -vx "28 00 00:00:00:00 00 00:01 00" -i x800<br>x 00000000 28 00 00:00:00:00 00 00:01 00 .. .. .. .. .. ..

      <p><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></p>
      <p> VERY helpful to have you send to us precisely what you see.<br>
      </p>
      <p>All this rubbish is meaningful to Me, since I typed the source
code.<br>
      </p>
      <p>We hear CD's come divided into data and not-data, and that an
x28 block read fails if addressed to where not-data appears on the
disk.&nbsp; But we really really really do Not know that, we know very
little of DVD/ CD as yet.</p>
      <p>We see the plscsi -v command your entered was:</p>
      <pre style="margin-left: 40px;"><big>plscsi -vx "28 00 00:00:00:00 00 00:01 00" -i x800<br></big></pre>
      <p></p>
      <p>We see PLScsi traced the 10 bytes of CDB copied Out:<br>
      </p>
      <pre style="margin-left: 40px;"><big>x ... 28 00 00:00:00:00 00 00:01 00 ...</big></pre>
      <p>We see PLScsi traced the content of the Data buffer after
trying to copy Data In:<br>
      </p>
      <pre style="margin-left: 40px;"><big>x ... AE:AE:...<br></big></pre>
      <p>We see PLScsi mention a failure to copy In x800 of the -i x800
Data In bytes you requested:<br>
      </p>
      <pre style="margin-left: 40px;"><big>// x800 (2048) residue</big><br></pre>
      <p>We see PLScsi traced the x12 bytes of Auto Sense copied In:</p>
      <pre style="margin-left: 40px;"><big>x ... 70:00:05:00 00:00:00:12 00:00:00:00 64:00 ...</big></pre>
      <p>We see the PLScsi summary of the Auto Sense bytes copied In is:<br>
      </p>
      <pre style="margin-left: 40px;"><big>// x 5 64 sense<br></big></pre>
      <p>We remember auto sense bytes have a structure often specified
together with op x03 Request Sense.&nbsp; The x70 byte means the
following bytes are "Current".&nbsp; Current bytes apply to the command
that failed, not some earlier command, unless SK is 6 "unit
attention".&nbsp; The x12 byte at offset 7 means as many as eighteen
(i.e. x12) meaningful bytes could follow, though plscsi tries to make
sense of only the six bytes that actually do follow.&nbsp; The "5 ...
64:00" nybble and bytes are the SK ASC ASCQ ("sense key", "additional
sense code", "additional sense code qualifier".<br>
      </p>
      <p>We remember this example summary implicitly refers to such
English as Fuji5r15.pdf:</p>

5 = Sense Key<br>
64 = ASC<br>
00 = ASC Q<br>
ILLEGAL MODE FOR THIS TRACK = Description<br>
CD Read = Type</p>
      <p>We see the PLScsi summary of all of this is:<br>
      </p>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <pre><big>// -x0102 = -258 = plscsi.main exit int</big></pre>
      </div>
      <p> We have not completed the design of exit codes for PLScsi, but
in the version of PLScsi shown here, the x0100 bitmask here again says
we asked to more data bytes than you managed to copy.&nbsp; The x0002
bitmask here again says the command failed with auto sense.&nbsp; Also
we're told x0102 = 258, not that we care</p>

      <h1>A.2. Decrypting Capacity</h1>
      <p>Among the first three commands we suggested trying, we include
op x25 Read Capacity because by that command, you discover bytes per
block and you can begin to guess the maxLba.&nbsp; But even that most
basic of SCSI commands includes a pitfall by design.<br>
      </p>
      <p>On paper, despite the name READ CAPACITY, T10 actually
requires that op to copy In a max Lba, not the disk capacity equal to
the count of blocks that many other ops copy In, including SCSI op x23
Read Format Capacities and Ata op xEC Identify.<br>

      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Fuji5r15.pdf</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">"14.20 READ CAPACITY command"</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">"The returned logical block address
and the block length in bytes are those of the last logical block on
the logical unit."</p>
      <p>That is, on paper, the device copies in the Lba of the last
block of the disk, not the Lba that points just past that block.&nbsp;
In practice we hear many devices report maxLba + 1 instead.&nbsp; Bugs
happen in device firmware too.&nbsp; Linux USB Storage defines the
connect option US_FL_FIX_CAPACITY to help overcome this popular
misunderstanding.<br>
      </p>
      <p>We once heard that people prefer the newer op x23, but we
still find drives that support only op x25, not op x23.<br>

      <h1>A.3. More Blocks Per Command Line<br>
      </h1>
      <p style="font-style: italic;">[ Editing incomplete here!&nbsp;
If you write <a href="mailto:p.lavarre@ieee.org">Pat LaVarre</a> to tell
us you got this far, then we'll finish faster.]</p>
      <p style="font-weight: bold;">You say you want to use plscsi.<br>
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Are you sure you want to do
more than read/write blocks?</span><br>
      </p>
      <p>We ask for Four reasons:<br>
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">1)</span><br>
      </p>
      <p>pldd only knows how to copy the 2 KiB/block = x800 byte/block
of DVD/ CD and the 0.5 KiB = x200 byte/block of HDD/ RMB.&nbsp; <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">If that's all you want to do, then the
extra options of plscsi may only confuse you pointlessly.</span><br>
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">2)</span><br>
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">With one pldd command line,
you can ask to try sending many CDB's.&nbsp; With one plscsi command
line, you send one CDB,</span> except for the -y and -n options that
repeat that CDB unchanged.&nbsp; With pldd, the parameter bs= specifies
the data bytes per CDB, and the parameter count= specifies how many
CDB's to send.<br>
      </p>
      <p>That difference in design <span style="font-weight: bold;">may</span>
matter to you if you <span style="font-weight: bold;">discover Windows
misbehaving when you exceed 64 KiB per CDB.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; I agree
you should be able to copy xFFFF blocks ( = 128 MiB / 2 KiB = 32 MiB /
0.5 KiB) with one CDB.&nbsp; Maybe thru Linux you can, but thru Windows
anything much above 64 KiB ( = x20 * 2 KiB = x80 * 0.5 KiB) causes
trouble in the host, even if the drive is ok.&nbsp; Rumour tells me
drives are often broken here too, because Windows makes them hard to
test here.&nbsp; Last I checked, Linux worked up to about 8 MiB per CDB.</p>
      <p style="font-weight: bold;">3)</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">pldd -v ..., if it works,
will have shown you some device names and CDB's that work.&nbsp;</span>
Also, when your intent actually is to shatter a read or write into a
series of CDB's with just a few bytes per CDB, often you'll find pldd
runs faster than plscsi. </p>
      <p>You could then duplicate those CDB's in plscsi with the
appropriate -i and -o options.&nbsp; Having duplicated these CDB's, you
could then change these CDB's.<br>
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">4)</span><br>
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Examples ...</span><br>
      </p>
      <p>With pldd, to read block x10:</p>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <pre><big>pldd.exe -v if=\\.\</big><big>A</big><big>: of=x10.bin bs=2k skip=x10 count=1</big></pre>
      </div>
      <p>With pldd, to read 16 blocks starting with block x450:<br>
      </p>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <pre><big>pldd.exe -v if=\\.\</big><big>A</big><big>: of=x450.bin bs=32k sbs=2k skip=x450 count=1</big></pre>
      </div>
      <p>With pldd, to read 5 * 16 blocks starting with block x450:<br>
      </p>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <pre><big>pldd.exe -v if=\\.\</big><big>A</big><big>: of=x450.bin bs=32k sbs=2k skip=x450 count=5</big></pre>
      </div>
      <p>The -v option should tell you you have achieved the effect:<br>
      </p>
      <pre style="margin-left: 40px;"><big>plscsi -x "28 00 00:00:04:50 00 00:10 00" -i x8000<br>plscsi -x "28 00 00:00:04:60 00 00:10 00" -i x8000<br>plscsi -x "28 00 00:00:04:70 00 00:10 00" -i x8000<br>plscsi -x "28 00 00:00:04:80 00 00:10 00" -i x8000<br>plscsi -x "28 00 00:00:04:90 00 00:10 00" -i x8000<br></big></pre>
      <p>Suppose you do choose to read blocks via plscsi rather than
pldd.&nbsp; You might then try something like:<br>
      </p>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <pre><big>plscsi -x "28 00 00:00:04:50 00 00:50 00" -i x28000</big></pre>
      </div>
      <p>This command probably won't work in Windows, because you're
asking for x2:8000 bytes/CDB i.e. more than x1:0000 = 64 KiB/CDB = (x20
* 2 KiB) per CDB.&nbsp; In Windows, you're supposed to throw away
thruput by shattering streams of read/write into tiny 64 KiB pieces.<br>
      </p>
      <p>What should work in Windows is something like:</p>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <pre><big>pldd -v if=\\.\R: of=x450.bin bs=x10000 count=3</big></pre>
      </div>
      <p>Notice plscsi/pldd only throw away colons found in CDB's, e.g.
we have to say bs=x10000, we cannot say bs=x1:0000.<br>
      </p>
      <p>That pldd -v option will tell you this command tried a
sequence of CDB's:<br>
      </p>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <pre><big>plscsi -x "28 00 00:00:04:50 00 00:20 00" -i x10000<br>plscsi -x "28 00 00:00:04:70 00 00:20 00" -i x10000<br>plscsi -x "28 00 00:00:04:90 00 00:20 00" -i x10000</big></pre>
      </div>
      <p>If you choose x1:0000 bytes/CDB = 64 KiB/CDB like this, then
with pldd you can't read just xA0 = 160 KiB = x2:8000 bytes.&nbsp;
Instead you have to read x3:0000 bytes.<br>
      </p>
      <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
      <h1>A.4. Correct CDB Lengths</h1>
Most standard CDB's contain a specific number of bytes - most often
six, ten, twelve, or sixteen bytes, but sometimes hundreds of bytes.<br>
      <br>
SCSI connections and devices vary in how they respond if you ask to
copy Out more or less than a whole CDB.<br>
      <br>
gccscsi will pass thru whatever you give it.&nbsp; plscsi requires the
-p option (also known as --please) to pass thru anything other than a
standard length.&nbsp; T10 publishes standard lengths for each opcode:
six bytes for ops x00..1F, ten bytes for ops x20..3F, and so on.<br>
      <br>
Some SCSI connections tolerate as many as twelve or sixteen bytes in
place of six or ten, especially if you zero the extra padding.&nbsp;
Some SCSI connections pad with zeroes if you ask to Copy Out too few
bytes, others pad with garbage.<br>
      <br>
Classic parallel SCSI connections tend to require precisely the correct
length.<br>
      <br>
      <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
      <h1>A.5. Whole Commands</h1>
      <p style="font-style: italic;">[ Editing incomplete here!&nbsp;
If you write <a href="mailto:p.lavarre@ieee.org">Pat LaVarre</a> to tell
us you got this far, then we'll finish faster.]</p>
      <p>I vehemently agree the CDB should unambiguously say how many
bytes of data to copy which way.&nbsp; I deeply regret that in fact the
CDB does not.&nbsp; I imagine we inherited this defect in protocol from
the IBM mainframes of the 1960's.</p>
      <p>plscsi works at a level below knowing that x28 means READ
(10), because SCSI does not promise you that x28 means READ (10),
although for DVD/ CD/ HDD/ RMB x28 usually does.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Consequently, to plscsi you have to specify more than the CDB
via the -x option, you also have to say how many bytes of data you want
to copy which way, via such options as -i and -o.&nbsp; At the level of
plscsi, the CDB alone is not the whole command, not unless you mean to
ask to copy no bytes of data.<br>
      <br>
      </p>
1)<br>
      <br>
Scsi differs from other protocols by neglecting to reserve a particular
bit of the CDB to always tell us which way we are copying data.<br>
      <br>
Specifically whether CDB[0] = x28 means read or write or something else
varies according to the kind of device you have addressed and the mode
the device is in.&nbsp; Yes, apart from bugs, in the default mode of
HDD/ DVD/ CD, CDB[0] = x28 READ (10).<br>
      <br>
More formally, every SCSI device should agree CDB[0] = x12 means
Inquiry (though in practice I hear some FireWire HDD always
disagree).&nbsp; The low five bits of the first byte of Data copied In
via an Inquiry command are the pdt (Peripheral Data Type).&nbsp; pdt x00
= HDD/ RMB and pdt x05 = DVD/ CD both say that CDB[0] = x28 thereafter
means READ (10), unless you put the drive into a vendor-specific mode
that redefines x28.<br>
      <br>
2)<br>
      <br>
So let's suppose you somehow grew confident that you know which way the
device will ask to copy data in response to a particular CDB.&nbsp; Well
now,<br>
      <br>
Next you have to ask how many bytes will the device ask to copy.<br>
      <br>
Scsi also makes this is ambiguous.<br>
      <br>
In particular, a standard op x28 READ(10) CDB says how many "blocks" to
copy, without bothering to define how long a "block" is.&nbsp; How long
a "block" is varies by drive, by disk, by opcode, by mode, etc.&nbsp; CD
usually start out with a block = 2 KiB.&nbsp; But you can ask to include
ecc, not just data, and other kinds of bits too.<br>
      <br>
      <p><br>
&gt; &gt; plscsi -vx "28 04 50 00 00 00 00 00 10 00"<br>
&gt; &gt; ... rude if compared to:<br>
&gt; &gt; plscsi -vx "28 04 50 00 00 00 00 00 10 00" -i x800<br>
      <br>
Correction, sorry.&nbsp; Both of those are rude.&nbsp; A copy of x10
blocks of x800 bytes each is x8000 bytes, not x800 bytes.<br>
      </p>
      <p><br>
      </p>
      <p>plscsi -vx "28 04 50 00 00 00 00 00 10 00"<br>
is rude if compared to:<br>
plscsi -vx "28 04 50 00 00 00 00 00 10 00" -i x800.<br>
      <br>
In the first case, we're sending a cdb to copy data, but in the same
breath we're implicitly telling plscsi Not to copy data, because we have
specified no -i and no -o option.&nbsp; We're contradicting ourselves.
This kind of thing tends to confuse Windows enough to crash it.&nbsp; In
the Usb Mass standard, this particular kind of contradiction is termed
Hn &lt; Di i.e. if the device thinks that the cdb meant to copy Data In
then the host is asking to copy No Data but the device is asking to copy
Data In and life goes downhill from there.</p>
      <p><br>
Notice you could deeply confuse, maybe even crash Windows if your -i
x24 interpretation of the CDB in fact did not agree with the device's
interpretation of the CDB.&nbsp; Serial FireWire &amp; USB connections
copy the -i x24 Out to the device, so the device gets a chance to notice
disagreements in interpretation, and a few devices in fact are that
smart.&nbsp; But parallel SCSI &amp; parallel ATAPI connections copy
only the CDB Out.&nbsp; Those protocols by design assume that the host
&amp; the device perfectly coordinate all interpretations of
CDB's.&nbsp; Violating that assumption is how FireWire HDD that choke
over op x12 cause so much trouble.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      </p>
      <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
      <h1>A.6. Less Auto Sense</h1>
      <p>If you trace the bus while you use plscsi, sometimes you will
see two commands rather than one.<br>
      </p>
      <p>This occurs if the first command fails with an "auto sensable"
status, such as a classic parallel SCSI x02 Check Condition or an
ATAPI&nbsp; x03 Status In of x01 ERR.&nbsp; After an auto sensable
status, the host automagically injects a second command, specifically
op x03 Request Sense.</p>
      <p>This fact violates the spirit of plscsi: you completely
control only the first command, not the possibly automagic second
command.</p>
      <p>This fact arises because auto sense has to happen below plscsi
to work reliably.&nbsp; Somewhere below plscsi we need code to
guarantee exclusive access to the device long enough to keep the auto
sense together with the CDB to which the auto sense refers.&nbsp; We
need exclusive access because op x03 Request Sense by definition refers
to the op that immediately preceded it and op x03 by definition "reads
and clears".<br>
      </p>
      <p>For example, suppose we have two threads in the host that send
commands that fail: cdb1 and cdb2.&nbsp; Say the auto sense for each is
as1 and as2.&nbsp; The only sequences that work are&nbsp; &lt;cdb1 as1
cdb2 as2 &gt; and &lt; cdb2 as2 cdb1 as1&gt;.&nbsp; Mixed sequences
like &lt;cdb1 cdb2 as1 as2&gt; get wrongs answers.&nbsp; In that
instance, cdb2 overwrites the sense of cdb1, as1 gets the error details
for cdb2 rather than cdb1, and as2 gets the zeroed sense left behind
when as1 read and cleared sense.<br>
      </p>
      <p> Clear so far?<br>
      </p>
      <p>Now, because auto sense happens below plscsi, we can't easily
control auto sense.<br>
      </p>
      <p>plscsi cannot see if auto sense occurs via op x03 Request
Sense as in classic parallel SCSI, ATAPI, USB, etc. or via some other
mechanism as in 1394/ Apple FireWire/ Sony iLink, etc.&nbsp; plscsi
never traces the auto sense CDB that plscsi does not see.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In an autosense CDB, byte 4 is the max count of auto sense
bytes to copy In across the bus.&nbsp; plscsi can't see that
either.&nbsp; plscsi can only specify the max count of auto sense bytes
to copy In to plscsi.&nbsp; Some SCSI bus drivers round that count up
to xFF, so that a bus trace always shows all the auto sense bytes that
op x03 implicitly clears after reading some or all of them.&nbsp; Some
SCSI bus drivers round the count off to align the count, or to match a
conventional choice, to avoid surprising the device.&nbsp; Conventional
choices for that byte include the x0E of Win 9X/ME and the x12 of Win
2K/XP.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The plscsi option -X sense x$XX exists to let you try asking
to copy different lengths of auto sense bytes into plscsi.&nbsp; We say
plscsi "should" define an option to let you misalign your auto sense
data on purpose, just as plscsi already defines the -a $page $offset to
let you misaligned your data on purpose.</p>
      <p>The -X sense x$XX option may not work well: despite our
academic interest, we don't find much use for that option in the real
world.&nbsp; We find many hosts choke over any but standard lengths.</p>
      <p>If you want to experiment as we have, we recommend you begin
with "unsolicited sense" i.e. explicitly choose to send an op x03 e.g.
plscsi -pvx "03 00:00:00 10 00" -i x10.&nbsp; Indeed, before that, we
recommend you begin with op x12 Inquiry e.g. plscsi -vx "12 00:00:00 10
00" -i x10.&nbsp; Once you understand those results, you have a chance
of understanding what -X sense x$XX will tell you.&nbsp; On the other
hand, we do know of hosts that transparently pass thru standard lengths
of auto sense but choke over unsolicited sense.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Remember, hosts tend to have trouble with lengths other than a
multiple of the word size of your motherboard.&nbsp; For example, we
imagine if you study auto sense carefully, you will discover that with
32 bit motherboards often you are copying in x10 bytes rather than x0E,
or x14 rather than x12.&nbsp; We say plscsi "should" make this
rounding-up more obvious.<br>
      <br>
Specific hosts often support undocumented ways of turning off auto
sense.&nbsp; As the length of auto sense bytes to copy In to plscsi, we
can try negative numbers, positive numbers in excess of xFF, and zero
itself.&nbsp; While indeed on paper the cdb -x "03 00:00:00 00 00" is
meaningful, zero auto sense isn't very meaningful: zero auto sense asks
to clear all sense data after reading zero bytes of sense data.&nbsp;
Consequently some hosts reserve length zero to mean do not auto sense.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Write to tell us if in fact one or more of the above "should"s
actually do matter to you, and we will get around to messing with them
in less years than otherwise.</p>
